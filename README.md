# Tools and Benchmarks

This repository contains the tools, datasets, and benchmark models used throughout my PhD research on gene regulatory network (GRN) inference and formal reasoning using the **RE:IN** framework.

Each top-level folder corresponds to a distinct biological system.  
Within each folder are exploratory models, and validation benchmarks encoded in RE:IN-compatible formats.

Readers are encouraged to consult the individual `README.md` files inside each folder for detailed descriptions on how to navigate each biological system
